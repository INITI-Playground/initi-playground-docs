#Getting started

The first step in creating games for the [INITI Playground](https://www.initiplayground.com) is to choose the SDK for the game engine you want to use. Currently, we offer an SDK for the Unity engine, allowing you to build custom content.

Future updates will include SDKs for other popular game engines, expanding your options and flexibility for development. Stay tuned for these additions, and in the meantime, get started with our [INITI Playground SDK for Unity](unity-sdk-download.md) to bring your innovative game ideas to life on the INITI Playground.
