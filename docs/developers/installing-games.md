## Prerequisites

Before installing the game, ensure you have completed the following steps:

- Prepared the game ZIP file by following the [this guide](preparing-games.md).
- Copied the ZIP file to a USB drive.
- Updated INITI Playground to version 1.0.7 or higher.

## Installing games

- Open the UI and click on the `Settings` tab at the top of the screen. Locate the games setup section, as illustrated in the picture below.

    </div>

- Connect your USB drive to the INITI Playground computer.
- Wait a few seconds for the system to recognize the USB drive.
- The system will automatically detect the drive and begin loading the list of available games.

    </div>

- Once the list is loaded, you will see the games available for installation in the `Available Games` panel on the left.

## Updating games

- Updating a game works similarly to installing a new one, but with the added convenience of replacing the previous version. If a newer version of the game is found on the USB drive compared to the one currently installed, an `Update` button will appear, allowing you to quickly install the latest version while removing the old one, as shown in the following picture.

    <div class="center imageWidth" markdown>
    ![Game update](assets/installing-game-update.jpg "Game update")
    </div>

    <div class="center" markdown>
        ```Please note that the available game version is 1.0.1, while the currently installed version is 1.0.0.```
    </div>

- To update, simply click the `Update` button and confirm. The previous version will be automatically uninstalled, and the new version will be installed in its place.
