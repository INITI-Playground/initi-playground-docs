# Exit button configuration

The exit button is included in all games that come with the INITI Playground. It allows users to exit a game and return to the main menu, providing a control over the interactive experience. It can be toggled on or off based on whether games should be started and switched by the players or by the operator.

## Locating exit button settings

- Open the UI and navigate to the `Settings` tab at the top of the screen.
- In the `General` settings menu, find the section dedicated to Exit Button Configuration, as shown in the picture below.

## Exit button position

You can configure the exit button to be positioned on the `LEFT`, on the `RIGHT`, or `DISABLED` entirely based on your preferences. Enabling the exit button allows players to control when to end a game session and return to the main menu.

## Exit button location

By adjusting the exit button location slider, you can control its vertical position on the screen. This is useful, for instance, if you want to keep the button accessible but out of reach of smaller children.

To get visual feedback on the exit button's location in settings, see the "Exit Button in the Game" placeholder. When you start a game, the exit button will appear in the same spot as shown in the settings. This is illustrated in the following screenshots.
