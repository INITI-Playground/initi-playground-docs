# Enabling touch in the Games tab

Touch control allows visitors to select and launch games directly by interacting with the projection surface. This creates a more intuitive and self-guided experience.

By default, touch is **disabled** because the sensor must be calibrated first to ensure accurate interaction.

## Enable touch

- Open the UI and navigate to the `Games` tab at the top of the screen.
- Click the **touch icon** in the top-right corner, as shown below.

<div class="center imageWidth" markdown>
![Enable touch](assets/enable-touch-disabled.jpg "Enable touch")
</div>

- Click `OK` to confirm enabling touch.

<div class="center imageWidth" markdown>
![Enable touch confirm](assets/enable-touch-confirm-on.png "Enable touch confirm")
</div>

- After confirmation, the touch icon turns **blue**, indicating that touch control is active.

Visitors can now browse, select, and launch games directly by touching the wall.

## Disable touch

In some installations, it may be preferable to prevent visitors from switching games. Disabling touch allows an operator or supervisor to manage game selection manually.

Typical use cases include supervised environments, scheduled programs, or events where a specific game should remain active.

- Open the UI and navigate to the `Games` tab.
- Click the **touch icon** in the top-right corner.

<div class="center imageWidth" markdown>
![Disable touch](assets/enable-touch-enabled.jpg "Disable touch")
</div>

- Click `OK` to confirm.

<div class="center imageWidth" markdown>
![Disable touch confirm](assets/enable-touch-confirm-off.png "Disable touch confirm")
</div>

- The touch icon will turn **grey**, indicating that touch is disabled.

Games can now be launched only using a wireless keyboard by operator.
