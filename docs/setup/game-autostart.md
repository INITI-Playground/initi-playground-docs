# Automatically start games on system power-up

INITI Playground can automatically launch a selected game when the system powers on. This feature is ideal for unattended installations such as museums, exhibitions, festivals, or public spaces where the system should start running without operator interaction.

## Locating auto game launch settings

- Open the UI and navigate to the `Settings` tab at the top of the screen.
- In the `General` settings menu, locate the `AUTO GAME LAUNCH` dropdown list, as shown in the image below.
- Select the game you want to start automatically after power-up.
- To disable automatic game launch, select `OFF` from the list.

## How it works

When enabled, the selected game will start automatically every time the system boots. No manual action is required from visitors or staff.

This setup is recommended for permanent installations where:

- visitors should immediately see an active experience
- operators are not present at all times
- the system needs to recover automatically after a restart or power outage

If manual control is preferred, keep the setting set to `OFF` so users can choose a game from the main menu.
