# Exiting games

To switch to a different game or return to the main menu, you must first exit the current game. There are two methods available for exiting: using the keyboard or, if touch input is enabled, by directly interacting with the screen.

## Using the wireless keyboard

- One way to exit a game is by pressing the `ESC` key on your wireless keyboard. This will close the game and return the INITI Playground to the main menu.

## Using touch

To exit a game using touch, you must first enable this feature in the settings menu (refer to the [Exit Button](exit-button.md) section). Once enabled, players can easily control the games and switch between them by touching the designated exit button on the screen and holding it for 2 seconds. This is particularly useful if you want to give players direct control over game selection and switching.
