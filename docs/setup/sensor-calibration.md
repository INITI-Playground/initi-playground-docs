# Sensor Calibration

Calibrating the sensor ensures that touch positions accurately correspond with the visual responses in games. Follow the steps below to complete the calibration process.

## Open the Settings Tab

Open the UI and click the `Settings` tab at the top of the screen.  
Locate the **Sensor Calibration** section, as shown in the image below.

!!! info
    The red arrow in the top center indicates the ideal location for mounting the sensor.  
    While placement here is not mandatory, best results are achieved when the sensor is **centered with the projection**.

    <!-- ADDED: emphasized centering for clarity -->

## Initiating Calibration

For accurate calibration, it is recommended to have an assistant help by touching each of the four red corners of the projection one by one.  

Your task:

1. Observe where the individual corner marks appear on the **blue curve** of the sensor.
2. Using your mouse, drag the corresponding corners of the **green rectangle** to align with these marks, matching the peaks of the blue curve.

This alignment defines the **entire touch area** for the sensor.

For a detailed demonstration, watch the video below for a **step-by-step guide**.

!!! warning
    If the blue flickering curve is not visible or the red corner marks do not appear, the sensor may be installed incorrectly.  
    Please review the [Sensor Installation](../installation/sensor-installation.md) video to check your setup.

## Resetting Calibration

To discard the current calibration and start over, click the `Reset Calibration` button at the bottom of the screen.

</div>

To prevent accidental resets, confirm this action by clicking `OK`.

## Next Steps

Now that you are familiar with the basics of calibration, including masking and testing, you’re ready to proceed.
