#Choosing aspect ratio

Before starting sensor calibration, select the correct projection aspect ratio.
Calibration depends on the projection size, so you must recalibrate INITI Playground whenever the aspect ratio is changed.

## Supported aspect ratios


| Aspect Ratio| Typical Resolution Example                 | Notes                                                        |
|:-----------:|:------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 16:9        | 3840×2160 (4K), 1920×1080, 1280×720        | Standard widescreen for most installations                   |
| 16:10       | 2560×1600, 1920×1200                       | Slightly taller format, good for business projectors         |
| 4:3         | 1600×1200, 1024×768                        | Classic format, works with older projectors                  |
| 5:4         | 1280×1024                                  | Less common, ideal for square walls.                         |
| 3:1         | Custom ultra-wide                          | Used for ultra-wide walls with custom content                |
| 10:3        | Custom ultra-wide                          | Used for ultra-wide walls with custom content                |


!!! note 
    Some games may not support all aspect ratios. Games that don’t match the selected ratio will be hidden in the Games tab.
