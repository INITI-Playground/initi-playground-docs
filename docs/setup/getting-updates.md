# Download and Install Updates

!!! success "Prerequisites"
    INITI Playground must be connected to the internet to receive updates.  
    If you have not completed this step yet, see the [Connecting to the Internet](connecting-to-the-internet.md) section first.

## Open the Updates Section

1. Open the UI and click the `Settings` tab at the top of the screen.
2. Navigate to the `About` section.

This section displays general system information, including the current software version, hardware key, and update status.

</div>

To install the update:

1. Click the `UPDATE` button.
2. The system will download and install the update automatically.
3. INITI Playground will restart and launch the updated version.
