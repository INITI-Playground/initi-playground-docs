# Selecting and starting games

Once the playground setup and calibration are complete, you likely won't need to visit the settings frequently. The main focus now is on selecting and launching games from the `Games` tab using either a wireless keyboard or, when touch is enabled, directly by touching the wall.

## Using the wireless keyboard

- Navigate to the `Games` tab at the top of the screen.
- Use the touchpad on the wireless keyboard to select the game you want to launch. You can navigate through the games using the arrows on the left and right or by clicking the small icons at the bottom of the screen, as illustrated in the picture below.

- Once youâ€™ve selected the game, click the play button located in the center of the screen to launch it.

## Using touch

- Ensure that touch functionality is enabled (refer to the [Enabling Touch in the Games Tab](enabling-touch.md) section).
- Select a game by touching the arrows on the sides, using a swipe gesture, or touching the game icons at the bottom of the screen.
- To launch a game, touch the play button in the center of the screen.
