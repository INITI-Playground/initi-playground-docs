# Selecting and starting games

After completing the initial setup and calibration, most daily operation happens in the `Games` tab. From here, you can browse installed games and start them using either a wireless keyboard or touch interaction.

## Using the wireless keyboard

- Navigate to the `Games` tab at the top of the screen.
- Use the touchpad on the wireless keyboard to browse available games.
- You can switch between games by:
    - clicking the arrows on the left or right side of the screen, or  
    - selecting the small game icons at the bottom, as shown below.
