## Adjust volume

Find the `VOLUME` slider and adjust it to set the overall volume level for the INITI Playground. 
!!! note
    Please note that this controls the general volume. Individual games also have their own settings menus where you can adjust game-specific volume and other related settings.


After configuring the volume and selecting the output device, click the `TEST SOUND` button. This will play a test sound to help you verify that the audio settings are correct and functioning as desired.
