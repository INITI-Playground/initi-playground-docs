## Adjust volume

Use the `VOLUME` slider to set the overall system volume for the INITI Playground.

!!! note
    This setting controls the master volume of the system.  
    Individual games may include their own audio settings where game-specific sounds and music levels can be adjusted separately.

## Test sound output

After selecting the output device and adjusting the volume, click the `TEST SOUND` button.

A short test sound will play so you can confirm that:

- the correct output device is selected
- the volume level is appropriate
