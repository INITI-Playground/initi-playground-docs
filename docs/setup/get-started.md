#Getting started

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    Before diving in, please ensure you have completed the installation process outlined in the [Installation](../installation/index.md) part of this documentation. Once the installation is done, this guide will help you get started by providing an overview of the user interface (UI).

<h3>UI Overview</h3>
The UI is divided into two main sections: Games and Settings. These can be easily navigated using the tabs located at the top of the screen, as illustrated in the picture below.

=== "Settings tab"
