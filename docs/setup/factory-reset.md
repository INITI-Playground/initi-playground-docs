# Factory Reset

If INITI Playground experiences issues that cannot be resolved through standard troubleshooting, you can perform a **factory reset**.  

This restores the system to its original settings and **erases all custom configurations and data**. Use this feature with caution, as any personalized settings will be lost.

## Performing a Factory Reset

1. Make sure a keyboard is connected to the INITI Playground system.
2. Press and **hold the `R` key** on the keyboard.
3. Continue holding the key for approximately **10 seconds**.
4. After the 10-second hold, the system will automatically begin the reset process.

- INITI Playground will **erase all user data and settings**, restoring the original factory configuration.
- Once the reset is complete and the system reboots, you can start a fresh setup and use the system as new.

!!! warning
    This action is **irreversible**. All system settings, game-specific settings, leaderboards, and any customizations in games will be deleted. After the reset, the system will load fresh versions of games from the backup.  
    You may also need to **update the system and games** after performing a factory reset.
