# Choosing the right projector

Since every space has unique dimensions and lighting conditions, the projector is not included with the INITI Playground package. You will need to select a projector based on your specific requirements. Here are the three main factors to consider:

- **Projection Distance:** To minimize shadows cast by players, a short-throw projector is recommended. These projectors allow you to place the device closer to the wall, reducing interference from players standing in front of the projection area.
- **Projector Brightness:** Ensure the projector is bright enough for the lighting conditions of your space. A higher brightness (measured in lumens) will be necessary in environments with strong ambient light to maintain clear visibility of the projection.
- **Resolution:** A minimum resolution of Full HD (1080p) is recommended for INITI Playground, but the system also supports higher resolutions, including 4K, for enhanced visual clarity and detail.
