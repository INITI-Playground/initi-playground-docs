Before installing INITI Playground, it is important to evaluate the available space and confirm that the environment meets the recommended installation requirements.

The video below explains the key spatial considerations for a successful setup:

- **Projection area** – recommended wall dimensions and optimal projection size for the best interactive experience.
- **Soft ball size** – minimum recommended soft ball size to ensure reliable detection and accurate interaction.
- **Projector placement** – required distance and positioning to achieve proper image coverage without interfering with players.
- **Player space** – recommended distance between players and the wall to ensure comfortable and safe gameplay.

Proper spacing is essential not only for gameplay quality but also for **player safety**. Before continuing, review the video and measure your installation area to confirm that it meets these requirements.
