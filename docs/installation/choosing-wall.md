# Choosing the right wall

Selecting a suitable wall is one of the most important steps when installing INITI Playground. The quality of the wall directly affects projection clarity, touch accuracy, and overall player experience.

## Requirements for a wall

When choosing a wall, consider the following requirements:

- **Solid structure**  
  The wall should be stable and durable enough to withstand frequent interaction, including players touching the surface or throwing soft balls. A rigid surface ensures consistent touch accuracy and long-term reliability.

- **Flat surface**  
  The wall should be as flat as possible. Uneven surfaces may distort the projected image or reduce interaction precision.

- **Minor obstacles**  
  Small obstacles such as electrical outlets or switches are acceptable, provided they do not protrude more than **5 cm** from the wall surface. Larger protrusions may interfere with projection alignment or touch detection.

- **Surface finish (recommended)**  
  Matte, light-colored walls provide the best visual results. Highly reflective, glossy, textured, or very dark surfaces may reduce projection visibility.

Choosing the right wall ensures reliable performance and a smooth interactive experience for players. For additional guidance and practical examples, watch the video below.

## Portable wall setup

For temporary installations or events, INITI Playground can also be installed using a **portable truss construction**.

This solution is useful when:

- ceiling mounting is not possible,
- drilling into walls or ceilings is restricted,
- the installation is temporary,
- the system is used outdoors (e.g., festivals, exhibitions, or touring events).

A truss structure can be used to build both:

- a projection wall frame, and/or
- a stable projector mounting tower.

This approach allows flexible deployment even in open spaces or non-permanent venues.
