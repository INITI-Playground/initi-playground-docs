# Choosing the right wall

When selecting a wall for your INITI Playground setup, there are a few important considerations:

- **Solid Structure:** The wall should be sturdy and durable enough to withstand interactions such as players throwing soft balls or touching it with their hands. A solid surface ensures consistent touch accuracy and player safety.
- **Flat Surface:** The wall must be as flat as possible to avoid disruptions in the interactive experience. Uneven surfaces can interfere with projection quality and touch recognition.
- **Minor Obstacles:** Small obstacles, such as electrical outlets or light switches, are acceptable as long as they don't protrude more than **5 cm** from the surface. These should not affect the touch recognition.

Choosing the right wall is key to ensuring a smooth and enjoyable interactive experience for players. For a detailed explanation, be sure to check the video below on selecting the right wall for INITI Playground.
